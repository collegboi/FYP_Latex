\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}

\section{Testing}

Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide information about the quality of the product or service under test. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements. In my project I am using test-driven approach method, this helps eliminate parts of the code that will not work or fix them before adding them to system.

\subsection{Service testing}

Service testing is where we test the individual services to ensure they are working and outcome are what is expected. This is done by creating a small flask server that will take HTTP requests from a client app for each service such as storage etc.
