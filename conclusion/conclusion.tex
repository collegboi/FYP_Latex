\section{Summary of Project Achievements}

\subsection{Reflective}

My project has changed from the beginning within a few months into it. I started out wanting to develop the back-end using Django framework and Python for the programming language. This changed to using Perfect ( Swift server side ) for the back-end and Swift language for both client and server. The reasons behind this because the project will be open sourced, it will allow developers already developing their apps in Swift to contribute towards it. Having software open source has its benefit which not only include having developers contributing and in return having free software. It can also help with providing more functionality, services and security to the system.

\subsection{Learning outcomes}

So far with the research, the project has potential to be completed without any major issues. There is a need for an open-source mobile backend a service for new and experienced developers, as current systems either are expensive or do not have enough services available. Conclusions I have come across and did not expect the outcome was with pushing the limits of what can be changed remotely in terms of user interface. The outcome is that it can be done, but still not sure how far I can go. As part of the research with talking to developers has been that the project has plausibility.
Personal development has been with research, the amount of done with this project out ways any other project done before. Researching my project idea has shown me skills to when developing software to always think ten steps ahead where possible. Instead of starting the development and researching along the way but start with the research has shown a completely new way to creating software. This way of creating software has advantages such as finding the potential issues and risks early on to overcome.
Speaking with professional mobile developers when I did the research has helped with the project with not only validating my idea that it has potential but also giving me constructive feedback. The feedback given has made me do more research regarding other services that companies are doing to look into. One developer I had an interview with also pointed out some areas to be cautious about. The research gone into this project apart from technologies and methodologies being used has shown the need for a mobile backend as a service.
