\begin{abstract}

Mobile applications are what we take everywhere with us, we are lost without them. Over the past number of years where mobile application development has boomed so has the number of new developers wanting to build applications. This project due to time will only concentrate on iOS mobile development and with the new programming language Swift. Youtube channels have increased with the amount of tutorials for iOS development, but there still can be room for improvement. Some new or experience developers can be put off by designing and creating a new application due to time and resources. Cloud services that govern the mobile industry are not cheap, and this will put developers off making their apps free.

The aim of this project is help speed up development and testing to be able to publish quicker, and to also provide a service that does not cost anything, that the developer has full control. This project will allow developers to contribute to add more functionality. This project will not only help in the development and testing parts, but also when the application is published. To be able to give the app a new look and feel without requiring a complete build and published.
