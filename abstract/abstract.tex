\begin{abstract}

Mobile applications are what we use in our everyday life, and over the past several years where mobile application development has expanded, so has the number of new developers wanting to build applications. This project will concentrate on iOS mobile development with the new programming language Swift. The number of YouTube channels have surged to meet the demand of iOS development education, but there still can be room for improvement. Some new and experienced developers can be put off designing and creating new applications due to time and resources. Cloud services that govern the mobile industry are not cheap and easy to use, and this can be an obstacle for making mobile applications.


The aim of this project is help speed up development and testing of mobile apps, to be able to publish quicker. This will give a service that does not cost anything, and that the developer has full control. The idea behind this will not only help in the development and testing sections but also when the application is published. To be able to give the app a new look and feel without requiring a complete build and publishing, and to allow the end-user more freedom with the design. This build will do alongside Apples strict and fair guidelines to ensure its validity.
