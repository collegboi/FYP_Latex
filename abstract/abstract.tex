Mobile applications are what we use everyday, they are part of our everyday life. Over the past number of years where mobile application development has boomed, so has the number of new developers wanting to build applications. This project due to time will only concentrate on iOS mobile development and with the new programming language Swift. Youtube channels have increased with the amount of tutorials for iOS development, but there still can be room for improvement. Some new and experience developers can be put off designing and creating a new application due to time and resources. Cloud services that govern the mobile industry are not cheap and easy to use, and this can be an obstacle for making mobile applications.

The aim of this project is help speed up development and testing, to be able to publish quicker, and to also provide a service that does not cost anything, that the developer has full control. The idea behind this will not only help in the development and testing parts, but also when the application is published. To be able to give the app a new look and feel without requiring a complete build and published, and to allow the end user more freedom with the design. This build will done along side Apples strict and fair guidelines to ensure its validity.
